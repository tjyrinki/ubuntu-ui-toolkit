"""Tests for the Ubuntu UI Toolkit components."""


# Note that the feedback loop that you get from testing QML components with
# Autopilot is bigger than what you would get by doing it with QtTest.
# So, the QML components need to be tested first in isolation at a lower level
# with QtTest, leaving Autopilot to test complex user interactions or user
# stories.
