 * \section2 Introduction
 * The \l{Styles}{style} defines the visuals, the implicit size of the component and may provide
 * additional logic for a given component. Some components have fixed style API the
 * component relies on, and yet some others do not have any restriction on what the
 * style contains or does. Components relying on a well defined API provide these
 * interfaces through Ubuntu.Components.Styles module, and styles must implement these
 * interfaces.
 *
 * The implicit size of a component is driven by the style as well, but it is not
 * mandatory for a style to provide those values, and components can override these
 * values at any time. However each style component is anchor filled to the styled
 * component and positioned to be under child components declared within the component
 * itself.
 *
 * Styles can be declared as Components (like delegates), in a separate document
 * loaded dynamically using a Loader or Qt.createComponent(), or can be grouped
 * in \l{Themes}{themes}. When declared in themes, with some exceptions, each component's style
 * document name is compound of the component name having the \e Style word as postfix,
 * followed by the typical QML file name extension. In this way the Button component's
 * style is ButtonStyle. In addition to styles, themes can also provide custom palette
 * values. There are two themes in Ubuntu, Ambiance and SuruDark themes, Ambiance
 * being the default theme. Both themes are declared in separate modules, in \c
 * Ubuntu.Components.Themes.Ambiance as well as \c Ubuntu.Components.Themes.SuruDark.
 * Application should define the theme name using this dotted name format.
 *
 * Applications can decide which theme they want to use or they can provide their
 * own themes. Also, applications can use multiple themes or set custom palette values.
 *

 *
 * \section2 Naming conventions
 * With few exception, each toolkit component is having StyledItem as its base
 * component. The component is aimed to be the base component for all styled
 * elements in the toolkit. Modules providing additional components to UI Toolkit
 * can also use this component as base, especially if they want to provide styling
 * capabilities.
 *
 * As mentioned, each styled component is having a style pair in a theme which is
 * implemented in a document named using the component name adding the \e Style word.
 * The \l {Button}'s style is implemented by \c ButtonStyle.qml document in the theme, and
 * \l Button is loading this style from the theme:
 * \qml
 * import QtQuick 2.4
 * import Ubuntu.Components 1.3
 *
 * AbstractButton {
 *     id: button
 *     // [...]
 *     styleName: "ButtonStyle"
 * }
 * \endqml
 * Developers can override the style in two ways, depending on how they want to style
 * the component:
 * \list
 *  \li 1. by overriding the style using an other style component from the theme, or
 *  \li 2. by overriding the style with a custom style component.
 * \endlist
 * But let's see first how the styles are implemented.
 *
 * \section2 Creating styles
 * As mentioned before, styles are not restricted to only provide visuals to a component or
 * set of components, but can have also logic which drives the component functionality.
 * These kind of styles must implement the given component's style API, listed in
 * \c Ubuntu.Components.Styles module.
 *
 * A good example of such a style is the ListItemStyle. The ListItem drives the style
 * animation through the \l ListItemStyle::animatePanels property, value being false when
 * the style is loaded during component creation, i.e. when the component requires some
 * visuals to be present at creation time. Also, ListItem informs the style when to
 * execute leading or trailing panel \l {ListItemStyle::rebound}{rebound}s and provides
 * the style the ability to overrule the \l {ListItemStyle::swipeEvent}{swipe} coordinates
 * calculated by the ListItem. On the other hand, the style must inform the component
 * about the position of the \l {ListItemStyle::dragPanel}{drag panel} so the dragging
 * (reordering of list items in a ListView) hot spot can be detected. A style implementation
 * must use the API provided by ListItemStyle, otherwise ListItem will fail to function
 * properly.
 *
 * Other styles are requested to provide additional \e content elements, which are then
 * positioned by the styled component separately from the main visuals given by the style.
 * A typical example of such a style API is the PullToRefresh component's style:
 * \snippet Styles/1.2/PullToRefreshStyle.qml 0
 * The default style implementation can be found under Ubuntu.Components.Themes.Ambiance
 * theme \l {http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/trunk/view/head:/src/Ubuntu/Components/Themes/Ambiance/1.3/PullToRefreshStyle.qml}
 * {PullToRefreshStyle.qml}.
 *
 * Beside these, component styles may provide default values for colors, fonts, widths,
 * margins, thicknesses.
 *
 * Each style component has a \c styledItem context property defined by the StyledItem,
 * which points to the StyledItem instance that uses the style. Style implementations can
 * access the actual styled item through this property.
 *
 * \section2 Overriding the default component style
 *
 * \section3 Override with a different style from the theme
 * Returning back to the ways to override a component's style, overriding by using a different
 * style from the theme can simply be done by assigning the document name to the \l {StyledItem::styleName}
 * {StyledItem.styleName} property as follows:
 * \qml
 * Button {
 *     id: button
 *     styleName: "SquaryButtonStyle"
 * }
 * \endqml
 * \note The document extension doesn't have to be specified, the style creation will automatically
 * append the .qml extension to it. This kind of style override assumes that the \c SquaryButtonStyle.qml
 * document is present in the theme.
 * This type of component styling makes sure the style will always have theme specific implementation
 * or coloring, however it also requires the style document to be present in all the themes
 * used by the application.
 *
 * \section3 Override with a custom component
 * The other way is to override the style with a local component not present in any theme.
 * The style component can be in-source (Component) or declared in a separate document,
 * loaded dynamically with Loader or Qt.createComponent(). This kind of override will make
 * sure the component will use the custom style no matter of the theme used. These styles
 * however can still use the theme palette to be in sync with the theme coloring.
 * \qml
 * Button {
 *     id: button
 *     style: Rectangle {
 *         implicitWidth: units.gu(12)
 *         implicitHeight: units.gu(5)
 *         color: styledItem.color
 *         border {
 *             width: units.dp(1)
 *             color: styledItem.strokeColor
 *         }
 *         Label {
 *             text: styledItem.text
 *             font: styledItem.font
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * \endqml
 * \note Specifying a component for the \l {StyledItem::style}{StyledItem.style} has precedence
 * over the \l {StyledItem::styleName}{StyledItem::styleName}. When both set, the stlke specified
 * \c style property will be used. When this property is set to undefined or null, the style specified
 * in \c styleName will be used. Obviously, when both properties are invalid, no style will be used.

 * \contentspage {Introduction} {Contents}
 *
 * A theme is a collection of style implementations. The style component names are
 * typically built using the component name and the Style word, exceptions being
 * documented per component.
 *
 * In addition to the styles the theme can provide palette values used by the style
 * and components. The palette values are defined in \c Palette.qml file, which must
 * either be derived from \l Palette component or from a parent theme's Palette.
 *
 * There are two types of themes, shared themes and application themes. These themes
 * do not differ in structure but in the way they are exposed. Shared themes are
 * located either under \b QML2_IMPORT_PATH or \b XDG_DATA_DIR. Application themes
 * are located under the application's private folder, therefore they are typically
 * serving the application styling needs, and cannot be shared. Shared themes are also
 * presented as QML extension modules, giving the possibility for application themes
 * to extend them.
 *
 * \note Yet there is no possibility to install shared themes into the system through
 * app store, only by providing them as part of the system image.
 *
 * The system provides two shared themes, \b Ambiance and \b SuruDark, the latest derived
 * from Ambiance theme. Both themes can be used as base theme in application themes,
 * by importing the modules defining them. If you decide to create a shared theme
 * that can be used also as base for custom or application themes, it is recommended
 * to do the same approach as the system themes do.
 *
 * \section2 Theme structure
 * \image surudark-theme.png
 * The theme structure is similar to a QML extension module structure, and this applies
 * to both shared and application themes. Contains component style documents, palette
 * description document, \c qmldir file and a special file called \c parent_theme. All
 * these files are optional in a theme depending on context.
 *
 * \c parent_theme is a special file which defines the theme the current one is derifed from.
 * The parent theme must be a shared theme and its name must be specified in dotted format.
 * For example SuruDark theme is located under \c{$QML2_IMPORT_PATH/Ubuntu/Components/Themes/SuruDark}
 * folder. This means that the theme name is identified by the \b Ubuntu.Components.Themes.SuruDark
 * dotted format.
 *
 * In addition to the files mentioned, themes can provide components supporting the styling
 * (i.e. components providing common visuals in the style implementations). Style implementations
 * can also provide additional APIs alongside the standard style API. These additional APIs are
 * typically there to configure the style itself, or to turn on/off features provided by styles
 * in derived themes.
 *
 * Starting with Ubuntu Components version 1.3, themes must provide versioned styles. This means
 * that themes must store the styles in subfolders, meaning that toolkit version 1.3 must have
 * the version specific styles under the theme's 1.3/ subfolder. The styling engine will look
 * for the styles based on the theme version used by the component. If the style is not found
 * with the requested version, it will fall back to the previous version of that style.
 * \image surudark-theme-13.png
 *
 * \section3 Standalone theme
 * A standalone theme is a theme which defines all style documents and theme palette,
 * and it is not derived from any theme. The only standalone theme UI Toolkit provides is
 * the Ambiance theme. Both shared and application themes can be standalone themes, however
 * Applications should make sure they implement all the styles used by the toolkit components
 * used in the application. \c qmldir file presence is mandatory only if the theme is
 * shared.
 *
 * \section3 Derived themes
 * As the name suggests derived themes are themes which use other themes (standalone or derived ones)
 * as base theme. These themes must have the \c parent_theme file which contains the
 * name of the theme they are derived from. These themes do not have to provide palette configuration
 * as long as they use the derived theme's palette values.
 *
 * Derived themes should only list those style components which overrule the derived style or
 * extend the derived style. The only requirement is to use the same document name as the parent theme
 * is having.
 *
 * Let's take SuruDark theme as en example. The theme is derived from Ambiance theme, and only
 * extends few style components. When theming engine loads the style components, it looks
 * after the styles starting from the current theme. If the style is not found there, it
 * tries to look after the style in the parent themes until it finds one.
 *
 * The extended (or even overridden) style component documents must follow the naming
 * convention, and must have the names implied by the components styled.
 *
 * The style imports the Ambiance theme module, and extends the Ambiance ListItemStyle
 * component. The same is done in the other style components. However, Palette defines
 * own values, and does not re-use Ambiance palette values.
 * \snippet Themes/SuruDark/1.3/Palette.qml 0
 *
 * \note If a theme derived from SuruDark wants to override style components not present
 * in SuruDark, they must import the SuruDark's parent theme in the style component.
 * As example, if FancyTheme would want to override the SwitchStyle, it would need to
 * import Ambiance module in the component as SuruDark doesn't have that style component
 * defined.
 * \qml
 * import QtQuick 2.4
 * import Ubuntu.Components 1.3
 * import Ubuntu.Components.Themes.Ambiance 1.3 as Ambiance
 * Ambiance.SwitchStyle {
 *     // [...]
 * }
 * \endqml
 *
 * \section2 Application themes
 * Application themes can also be standalone or derived themes. Usually applications
 * need slight differences on certain component styles, colors. These can be configured
 * in multiple ways, depending on the needs of the application. Applications can decide
 * to have their own theme, and override the palette value in the theme, or to use the
 * system themes and override few color values from the theme palette.
 *
 * Let's take an example of an application which changes some palette values of SuruDark
 * theme.
 *
 * First, the application has to define the theme, preferably in a separate folder (e.g.
 * theme). The folder should contain a \c parent_theme file with the content
 * \code
 * Ubuntu.Components.Themes.SuruDark
 * \endcode
 * This will make sure theme engine will look after the style components that are not
 * defined by the application theme inside the parent theme. Remember, the parent themes
 * can have parent themes (SuruDark is derived from Ambiance) in which case the style components
 * will be looked up in all these themes.
 *
 * As shown next, the application can define the palette.
 * \snippet customtheme/theme/Palette.qml 0
 * Note that the palette uses the SuruDark palette as base, and changes few colors from it.
 *
 * The application can use its own theme in the following way:
 * \snippet customtheme/main.qml 0
 *
 * \note An application, which overrides multiple shared theme versions must provide separate
 * style versions in its theme so the styling engine can identify the proper styles for the
 * components. Note however that this is not mandatory, and it is up to the application developer
 * to decide whether the application should support multiple style versions or not.

/*!
 * \page ubuntu-theming-subtheming.html
 * \title Sub-theming
 * \previouspage Themes
 * \contentspage {Introduction} {Contents}
 *
 * There can be situations when an application has a design which combines styles from different
 * themes, which would not be possible or would be hard to be combined in a single theme. In these
 * situations developers can use different themes in the components and its child components.
 * This is called sub-theming, which was introduced in Ubuntu.Components 1.3.
 * The only thing the application has to do is to define a ThemeSettings instance for the
 * component which is desired to use a different theme.
 * \qml
 * import QtQuick 2.4
 * import Ubuntu.Components 1.3
 * import Ubuntu.Components.Popups 1.3
 * MainView {
 *     width: units.gu(40)
 *     height: units.gu(71)
 *
 *     applicationName: "subthemed"
 *
 *     // make sure the main theme is Ambiance
 *     theme.name: "Ubuntu.Components.Themes.Ambiance"
 *
 *     Component {
 *         id: dialogComponent
 *         Dialog {
 *             id: dialog
 *             title: "Input dialog"
 *             // the dialog and its children will use SuruDark
 *             theme: ThemeSettings {
 *                 name: "Ubuntu.Components.Themes.SuruDark"
 *             }
 *             TextField {
 *                 placeholderText: "enter text"
 *             }
 *             Button {
 *                 text: "Close"
 *                 onClicked: PopupUtils.close(dialog)
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     Button {
 *         text: "Open dialog"
 *         onClicked: PopupUtils.open(dialogComponent)
 *     }
 * }
 * \endqml
 *
 * Another use-case is when a different palette set is needed in the application.
 * One way to achieve that is to define a custom theme for the application, however
 * that theme must be derived from one particular theme, so the application will be
 * restricted to one given theme. If we want to have the same palette values to be used
 * no matter where the component is used, we can override the palette values we want to
 * change, by setting the theme palette to a \l Palette instance where only the desired
 * palette values are changed. This can be combined with sub-theming, which will make
 * sure that the palette values are applied only on a certain component sub-tree.
 *
 * The following example makes sure the Dialog and its child components will use a given
 * palette value:
 * \qml
 * import QtQuick 2.4
 * import Ubuntu.Components 1.3
 * import Ubuntu.Components.Themes 1.3
 *
 * MainView {
 *     width: units.gu(40)
 *     height: units.gu(71)
 *
 *     applicationName: "subthemed"
 *
 *     Component {
 *         id: dialogComponent
 *         Dialog {
 *             id: dialog
 *             title: "Input dialog"
 *             // make sure the dialog and its children will use the same
 *             // theme as the rest of the application
 *             theme: ThemeSettings {
 *                 name: parentTheme.name
 *                 palette: Palette {
 *                     id: config
 *                     normal {
 *                         foregroundText: UbuntuColors.blue
 *                         overlayText: "#BAFEDC"
 *                     }
 *                     selected {
 *                         fieldText: "brown"
 *                         foregroundText: Qt.rgba(0, 0, 1, 1)
 *                         overlayText: config.normal.overlayText
 *                         foreground: UbuntuColors.green
 *                     }
 *                 }
 *             }
 *             TextField {
 *                 placeholderText: "enter text"
 *             }
 *             Button {
 *                 text: "Close"
 *                 onClicked: PopupUtils.close(dialog)
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     Column {
 *         spacing: units.gu(1)
 *         Button {
 *             text: "Set Ambiance theme"
 *             onClicked: theme.name = "Ubuntu.Components.Themes.Ambiance"
 *         }
 *         Button {
 *             text: "Set SuruDark theme"
 *             onClicked: theme.name = "Ubuntu.Components.Themes.SuruDark"
 *         }
 *         Button {
 *             text: "Open dialog"
 *             onClicked: PopupUtils.open(dialogComponent)
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * \endqml
 * \note Note the way the theme is changed! The first two buttons actually change the
 * name of the theme they inherit, which is the application's theme. This means that
 * the theme will actually be changed on the entire application, not only on the Button
 * itself.
 *
 * The Dialog uses the \l {ThemeSettings::parentTheme}{parentTheme} property to load
 * the same theme as its parent styled item is using, meaning that the Dialog will
 * also load the same theme as the application does, and will change the loaded palette
 * values with the ones defined in the \c config Palette instance, namely the \c
 * foregroundText and \c overlayText of \c normal, as well as \c fieldText, \c foregroundText,
 * \c overlayText and \c foreground on \c selected groups.
 *
 * There may be cases when a subset of components wants to use different style versions
 * than the one provided by the module version. Remember, using earlier minor versions
 * of the theme is perfectly fine while using newer versions may not work, as component
 * styles may use newer APIs of the component which is not present in the component, thus
 * the style will fail.
 *
 * Let's take the example above, and assume that we want to show the Dialog with the same
 * theme as the application but with an earlier version. We can do this by specifying the
 * theme version with \l {Ubuntu::version}{Ubuntu.version()} as follows:
 * \qml
 * import QtQuick 2.4
 * import Ubuntu.Components 1.3
 * import Ubuntu.Components.Themes 1.3
 *
 * MainView {
 *     width: units.gu(40)
 *     height: units.gu(71)
 *
 *     applicationName: "subthemed"
 *
 *     Component {
 *         id: dialogComponent
 *         Dialog {
 *             id: dialog
 *             title: "Input dialog"
 *             // make sure the dialog and its children will use the same
 *             // theme as the rest of the application
 *             theme: ThemeSettings {
 *                 name: parentTheme.name
 *                 // use version 1.2 of the theme
 *                 version: Ubuntu.version(1, 2)
 *             }
 *             TextField {
 *                 placeholderText: "enter text"
 *             }
 *             Button {
 *                 text: "Close"
 *                 onClicked: PopupUtils.close(dialog)
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     Column {
 *         spacing: units.gu(1)
 *         Button {
 *             text: "Set Ambiance theme"
 *             onClicked: theme.name = "Ubuntu.Components.Themes.Ambiance"
 *         }
 *         Button {
 *             text: "Set SuruDark theme"
 *             onClicked: theme.name = "Ubuntu.Components.Themes.SuruDark"
 *         }
 *         Button {
 *             text: "Open dialog"
 *             onClicked: PopupUtils.open(dialogComponent)
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * \endqml
