// Static flow control (branching on a uniform value) is fast on most GPUs (including ultra-low
// power ones) because it allows to use the same shader execution path for an entire draw call. We
// rely on that technique here (also known as "uber-shader" solution) to avoid the complexity of
// dealing with a multiple shaders solution.
// FIXME(loicm) Validate GPU behavior with regards to static flow control.
