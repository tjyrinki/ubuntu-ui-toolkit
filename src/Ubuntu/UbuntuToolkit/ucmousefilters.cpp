   \brief Attached property filtering mouse events occured inside the owner.

   Sometimes we need to provide additional functionality on mouse events beside
   a QML element's default behavior. Placing a MouseArea over a component however
   will grab the mouse events from the component underneath, no matter if we set
   \a preventStealing to false or not. Setting mouse.accepted to false in \a onPressed
   would result in having the event forwarded to the MouseArea's parent, however
   MouseArea will no longer receive other mouse events.

   \qml
   import QtQuick 2.4

   TextInput {
       width: 100
       height: 20
       MouseArea {
           anchors.fill: parent
           preventStealing: false
           // do not accept event so it gets propagated to the parent item
           onPressed: mouse.accepted = false;
           onReleased: console.log("this will not be printed")
       }
   }
   \endqml

   Ubuntu UI Toolkit declares filter components similar to Keys, which can be
   attached to any visual primitve. Mouse filter however will have effect only
   when attached to items handling mouse events. Events are handled through signals,
   where the event data is presented through the \a mouse parameter. Events
   should be accepted if the propagation of those to the owner is not wanted.
   This is not valid to \l onClicked, \l onPressAndHold composed events.

   The previous code sample using Mouse filter, which will print the pressed and
   released mouse buttons would look as follows:
   \qml
   import QtQuick 2.4
   import Ubuntu.Components 1.2

   TextInput {
       width: 100
       height: 20
       // do not accept event so it gets propagated to the parent item
       Mouse.onPressed: console.log("mouse button pressed: " + mouse.button)
       Mouse.onReleased: console.log("mouse button released: " + mouse.button)
   }
   \endqml

   The event details are reported in the \a mouse parameter, of MouseEvent
   type, which extends QtQuick's MouseEvent with additional properties.

   The filter will accept the same mouse buttons the owner accepts, and will accept
   hover events if the owner does. However it is not possible to alter these settings
   through the filter. If button handling other than the default ones specified for
   the primitive is required, MouseAreas can be declared to handle those events.

   Example of handling right button clicks over a TextInput:
   \qml
   import QtQuick 2.4
   import Ubuntu.Components 1.2

   TextInput {
       width: 100
       height: 20

       MouseArea {
           anchors.fill: parent
           acceptedButtons: Qt.RightButton
           onClicked: console.log("right button clicked")
       }
   }
   \endqml
   In this example left and middle mouse button clicks will reach TextInput as
   MouseArea only grabs right button events.

   Mouse filter can be used in combination with MouseArea, where the filter brings
   additional functionality on top of existing primitive functionality, and MouseArea
   add new functionality to the primitive.

   \qml
   import QtQuick 2.4
   import Ubuntu.Components 1.2

   TextInput {
       width: 100
       height: 20
       // do not accept event so it gets propagated to the parent item
       Mouse.onPressed: {
           if (mouse.button === Qt.LeftButton) {
               // do something
           }
       }
       MouseArea {
           anchors.fill: parent
           acceptedButtons: Qt.RightButton
           Mouse.onPressed: console.log("right button clicked")
       }
   }
   \endqml

   As mentioned, mouse filters can be attached to any visual item. Attaching it
   to items that do not handle any mouse events will not have any effect. However
   child items which handle mouse events can forward the events they handle to
   their parent. In this way mouse events will land in these items too, and mouse
   filter attached to those can also handle the event. This is useful when creating
   custom types where the mouse handling item is nested into a non-mouse handling
   one, and we want to provide additional filtering possibility to the user. These
   type of items are called proxy handlers.

   \qml
   Item {
       id: top
       width: 100
       height: 50

       Mouse.onPressed: console.log("mouse received from input")

       TextItem {
           anchors.fill: parent
           Mouse.forvardTo: [top]
           Mouse.onPressed: console.log("pressed over input")
           Mouse.onPressAndHold: console.log("longpress handled here")
       }
   }
   \endqml

   In this example the mouse press is first handled by the mouse filter attached
   to TextInput, then it is forwarded to the top item and finally to the TextInput.
   Accepting the mouse event will stop propagation to the top item as well as to
   the TextInput. The topmost item itself does not handle mouse events, therefore
   it will be a sinple proxy handler item. However, proxies can themself handle
   mouse events. Therefore each mouse event signal has the \a host parameter specifying
   the sender of the mouse event reported.

   \note The forwarded events are handled in the proxy handlers only if the mouse
   position points inside their area. If the forwarded mouse position falls outside
   the target area, the event will not be reported, however will be forwarded further
   to the items in the list. In the following example the mouse press in red rectangle
   will be printed as well as the proxied mouse press from the main item.
   \qml
   import QtQuick 2.4
   import Ubuntu.Components 1.2

   Item {
       id: main
       width: units.gu(40)
       height: units.gu(71)

       Mouse.onPressed: console.log("got the mouse press forwarded by " + host.objectName)

       Column {
           anchors.fill: parent
           spacing: units.gu(1)

           Rectangle {
               id: blueRect
               objectName: "BlueRect"
               width: parent.width
               height: units.gu(20)
               color: "blue"
               Mouse.forwardTo: [main]
               Mouse.onPressed: console.log("This should not be printed")
           }
           Rectangle {
               objectName: "RedRect"
               width: parent.width
               height: units.gu(20)
               color: "red"
               MouseArea {
                   anchors.fill: parent
                   Mouse.forwardTo: [blueRect]
                   Mouse.onPressed: console.log("Pressed in " + host.objectName)
               }
           }
       }
   }
   \endqml

   An interesting feature that can be achieved using Mouse filter is the event
   "transparency" towards the MouseArea lying behind the items which handle mouse
   events. This means for example that by forwarding mouse events occurred on a
   TextInput to a MouseArea that stays behind it in the item hierarchy, the
   MouseArea will also get all the events occurred on the area covered by the
   TextInput, acting like it would be above the TextInput. However, due to the
   nature of the MouseArea event acceptance policy (all events are accepted by
   default) TextInput will not get these mouse events unless we set the \a accepted
   field of the mouse event to false in MouseArea. This normally leads to the
   MouseArea no longer getting further mouse events. However, Mouse filter will
   continue to forward other mouse events to the MouseArea, so setting \a accepted
   to false in \a onPressed, \a onReleased will not have the default effect. This
   is only valid to press and release events, double-click or mouse position change
   will be blocked by the MouseArea still.
   \qml
   import QtQuick 2.4
   import Ubuntu.Components 1.2

   MouseArea {
       id: topArea
       width: units.gu(50)
       height: units.gu(10)

       onPressed: {
           console.log("forwarded pressed")
           mouse.accepted = false
       }
       onReleased: {
           console.log("released")
           mouse.accepted = false
       }

       TextInput {
           width: units.gu(40)
           height: units.gu(5)
           anchors.centerIn: parent

           Mouse.forwardTo: [topArea]
           Mouse.onPressed: console.log("input pressed")
           Mouse.onReleased: console.log("input released")
       }
   }
   \endqml


   Mouse filter provides ability to control the order of the event dispatching.
   The filter can receive the events prior the owner or after the owner. This
   can be controlled through the \l priority property. In the following example
   we make sure the TextInput always receives the events before the filter:
   \qml
   import QtQuick 2.4
   import Ubuntu.Components 1.2

   TextInput {
       id: input
       width: units.gu(40)
       height: units.gu(5)
       activeFocusOnPress: true

       Mouse.prority: Mouse.AfterItem
       Mouse.onPressed: if (input.activeFocus) console.log("Text input already handled it")
   }
   \endqml

   Another feature of the mouse filters is the ability to restrict when the composed
   events like \l onClicked and \l onPressAndHold should be triggered. By default
   these events are triggered no matter what is the distance between the mouse pressed
   position and the current position after a certain timeout (for \l onPressAndHold)
   or upon mouse release (for \l onClicked). In this way the \l onClicked will be
   emitted even if the user presses the mouse at the left-top edge of the component,
   then moves it to the right-bottom corner and releases it. This may not be the
   preferred behavior on certain components (like TextInput). Therefore MouseFilter
   provides a property which can alter this behavior, the \l clickAndHoldThreshold.
   This property specifies the radius of the area the up-mentioned composed events
   are emitted during a mouse move.

   \qml
   import QtQuick 2.4
   import Ubuntu.Components 1.2

   TextInput {
       width: units.gu(40)
       height: units.gu(5)
       activeFocusOnPress: true
       selectByMouse: true

       // emit composed events only if the mouse moves within 2 GU radius area
       Mouse.clickAndHoldThreshold: units.gu(2)
       Mouse.onClicked: console.log("click happened within threshold value")
       Mouse.onPressAndHold: console.log("pressAndHold happened within threshold value")
   }
   \endqml

   Similar functionality for the case when the mouse event occurs outside of the
   owner is brought by the \l InverseMouse attached property.

   \section1 Mouse events synthesis
   QtQuick automatically creates artificial mouse events whenever a scene receives
   touch events that are not consumed by any item (either by using MultiPointTouchArea
   or a custom C++ item). The Mouse filter provides the possibility to ignore
   synthesized mouse events by enabling the \l ignoreSynthesizedEvents
   property.

   This is really useful when, while developing a convergent application, the app developer
   wants to avoid triggering the hovering logic using a touchscreen,
   but still be able to handle the hover events when using a mouse, and at the same time
   doesn't want to stop the mouse and touch events from propagating to items underneath the
   MouseArea which handles the hovering.
   The following is an example of how that functionaly can be implemented:
   \qml
    MouseArea {
        id: proximityArea
        anchors.fill: parent
        propagateComposedEvents: true
        hoverEnabled: true

        //We use a separate variable to detect whether the area contains
        //a mouse, because MouseArea's containsMouse is true even when
        //tapping on it using a touchscreen (due to the touch events being
        //converted to mouse events if no item consumes them).
        property bool containsPointerDevice: false

        //handle hover events using the Mouse filter instead of MouseArea, so that
        //we can ignore synthesized mouse events and not trigger hover logic when the
        //user is interacting with the app using a touch device.
        Mouse.ignoreSynthesizedEvents: true
        Mouse.onEntered: {
            console.log("ONLY A MOUSE CAN TRIGGER THIS SLOT")
            proximityArea.containsPointerDevice = true
        }
        Mouse.onExited: proximityArea.containsPointerDevice = false

        //let mouse and touch events propagate underneath the mouse area
        onPressed: mouse.accepted = false
    }
   \endqml

   \brief Attached object filtering mouse events occured outside the owner.

   Similar to Mouse filter attached property, provides mouse event filtering
   capabilities but for events occurring outside of the owner's area, excluding
   the input method area.

   Being derived from Mouse filter element, provides the same behavior as the
   Mouse filter, except that all the signals are emitted when the mouse event
   occurs outside the owner's area. Note that accepting composed mouse events
   does not have any effect on event propagation.

   Altering \a priority property has no effect on inverse mouse filter as mouse
   events captured by the filter are not forwarded to the owner, hence forwarding
   those events first to the owner will not have any effect.
